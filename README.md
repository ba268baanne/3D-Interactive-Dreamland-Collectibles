# Dreamland Collectibles

Built and designed by [Chloe Hung](https://github.com/chloehungdev)

Dreamland Collectibles is a small passion project I built to explore how 3D, motion, and e-commerce can come together in a playful way.  
It’s inspired by collectible culture — Popmart, claw machines, plush figures — but built entirely in code.  
My goal was to make a store that feels alive and interactive instead of static grids and buttons.

## Concept & Notes

This project started as a quick proof of concept for a client who wanted a collectible store that felt more like a “toy world” than a website.  
It turned into something I really enjoyed experimenting with — especially mixing scroll triggers with lighting and texture.

> Still refining details like transitions and lighting — the idea is to make users feel like they’re exploring a digital toy shelf.

## Development Notes

This project was originally configured with Base44 for AI-driven API integrations and image generation.  
It has since been refactored to use local API stubs for improved modularity and seamless deployment on Vercel.  

This setup keeps the app lightweight and functional without external dependencies,  
while maintaining flexibility to reintegrate Base44 or other APIs in future iterations.

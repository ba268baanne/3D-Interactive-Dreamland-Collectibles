# Dreamland Collectibles

Built and designed by [Chloe Hung](https://github.com/chloehungdev)

Dreamland Collectibles is a small passion project I built to explore how 3D, motion, and e-commerce can come together in a playful way.  
It’s inspired by collectible culture — Popmart, claw machines, plush figures — but built entirely in code.  
My goal was to make a store that feels alive and interactive instead of static grids and buttons.

## Concept & Notes

This project started as a quick proof of concept for a client who wanted a collectible store that felt more like a “toy world” than a website.  
It turned into something I really enjoyed experimenting with — especially mixing scroll triggers with lighting and texture.

> Still refining details like transitions and lighting — the idea is to make users feel like they’re exploring a digital toy shelf.
